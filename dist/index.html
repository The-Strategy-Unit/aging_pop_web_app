        How much healthcare will our population need in five, ten, 20 years&rsquo; time? </span>
        Looking into the future is challenging, but those planning publicly funded
        health services, whether in government departments, regional health systems, or
        local services must be ready with answers.</p>
        <p class="narrative"> 
        The <a title="Strategy Unit" target="_blank" href="https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/">Strategy Unit</a> has developed an interactive tool to show how population aging
        and other demographic changes will impact the future need for different types of
        hospital services in your local area.</p>
        <p class="narrative">
        The demography of the UK is changing as people live longer, but the age and sex
        structure of local areas can differ greatly depending on where you are. Coastal
        areas in the South and East of England have the oldest populations. Big cities
        with large student communities and London Boroughs with large foreign-born
        populations have the youngest inhabitants.</p>
        <p class="narrative">
        By showing how populations are composed, and crucially how they are expected to
        change, population pyramids help bring these differences to life. Contrast the
        Christmas tree-shape of the Barking and Dagenham population with the
        rectangular-shape of Worcestershire.</p>
        <p class="narrative">
        The future shape of our population will be determined by trends in births,
        deaths, and migration. To help with decision-making the <a title="Office for National Statistics" target="_blank" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/">Office for National
        Statistics</a> (ONS) publish population projections that tell us about the possible
        future size and makeup of our population. To assess and communicate the
        uncertainty associated with their projections the ONS construct alternative
        scenarios. For example, what if international migration declined from relatively
        high historical levels or what if women continued to have fewer children than in
        the past.</p>
        <p class="narrative">
        Choose from 10 variant projections (alongside the principal projection) and
        watch how the age and sex structure changes in your area to 2043.</p>

        <h2>The relationship between age and healthcare use</h2>
        <p class="narrative">
        The increased likelihood of morbidity and mortality that comes with increasing
        age means use of healthcare tends to be higher among the old than the young.
        This is especially true for treatment of physical health conditions provided in
        hospitals.</p>
        <p class="narrative">
        The relationship between people&rsquo;s age and their use of healthcare is best shown
        by &lsquo;age-related activity profiles&rsquo;, which plot the average number of treatments
        (e.g., hospital stays, A&E attendances etc.) per head of population against age.</p>
        <p class="narrative">
        Demand for services with the steepest <i>profiles</i>, like A&E visits by ambulance and
        unplanned admissions, will be most affected by population aging because the
        average age of patients in these groups is much higher than, for example, walk-in
        A&E visits or most outpatient services.</p>
        <p class="narrative">
        You can view the activity profiles for your local area across eleven service
        types covering all three main settings for hospital care (A&E, inpatients, and
        outpatients).</p>

        <h2>Modeling future healthcare activity</h2>
        <p class="narrative">
        The primary driver of need for health and related services is the size and age
        structure of the population (European Commission, 2024). Therefore, a reasonable
        starting point might be to take the level of healthcare provided now and make
        adjustments based on expected changes in the size and age structure of the
        population served. In a typical modelling exercise, activity profiles like the
        ones shown above are multiplied by the respective age/sex population group in
        some future year.</p>
        <p class="narrative">
        However, while most types of healthcare activity increase with age, age itself
        is not the underlying cause; demand for and use of healthcare depends ultimately
        on health status and functional ability. It is entirely possible for a
        population to both age and become healthier. In such a scenario, future gains in
        life expectancy are spent in good health, resulting in a hypothetical future
        75-year-old having better health than a 75-year-old today. The compression of
        morbidity hypothesis (Fries, 1980) has a long-established theoretical
        underpinning, and its popular interpretation lies behind headlines such as, &lsquo;Is
        60 is the new 50?&rsquo; (Levine, 2018). In a more dystopian future, average lifespan
        is prolonged, but the prevalence of chronic diseases and disabilities increases
        sharply (Gruenberg, 1977. Kramer, 1980).</p>
        <p class="narrative">
        Unpicking which of these paths population health will travel is far from
        straightforward. Health status is a multidimensional concept that does not lend
        itself to easy measurement. The evidence that does exist on long-term trends in
        health status whether it be prevalence of chronic conditions, disability, or
        self-assessed general health is mixed. Yet the question of how population health
        status will evolve in relation to changes in life expectancy&mdash;will the additional
        years of life that recent cohorts have gained (and stand to gain) be spent in
        good health or disability and frailty&mdash;is of great significance to those involved
        in decisions about future healthcare resource requirements.</p>
        <p class="narrative">
        Where high quality empirical evidence is missing decision-makers often seek out
        expert opinion. Fortunately, there are established procedures for obtaining and
        pooling analytical judgements from groups of experts. The most useful approaches
        allow for uncertainty to be quantified in the form of a probability
        distribution. In October 2022, a group of independent experts were asked for
        their view on the future health of the population in England. Broadly, the
        consensus view was that the most likely outcome was for the share of remaining
        life spent in good health (free of limiting long-standing illness) at age 65
        years to fall slightly by 2035. However, there was a considerable degree of
        uncertainty around this central view. The group also judged the balance of
        risk to be asymmetrical with a greater chance that the decline in health status
        might be less than their central view or even that it might improve compared
        with the chances of it worsening by more than their central view. We use the
        probability distribution from this exercise to adjust our estimate of future
        healthcare activity.</p>
        <p class="narrative">
        You can view the results of our modeling for your local area across eleven
        different service types covering the three main settings for hospital care (A&E,
        inpatients, and outpatients) in 5-year steps to 2040. The charts explicitly show
        the uncertainty associated with how population health status might evolve. The
        progression from purple (more probable) to yellow (less probable) stripes
        portrays the frequency of outcomes from a Monte Carlo simulation. Uncertainty
        associated with how future trends in fertility, mortality and migration might
        affect the size and age structure of an area&rsquo;s population can be explored by
        selecting one of 10 variant population projections.</p>
